shipedit -- WipeOut Pulse PSP Ship Skin Editor
Copyright (c) 2021 Thomas Perl <m@thp.io> -- https://thp.io/2021/shipedit/

An unofficial/fan-made ship skin editor for the 2007 PSP game WipEout Pulse.


QUICK START
-----------

This tool allows you to create ship skins (liveries) for WipEout Pulse. It can
load and export 256x256 PNG files as well as the "16034453" savegame format.

The saved PNG files are useful for sharing online -- pixel metadata is written
in the lower right section of the image so that the view settings, team info
and save slot are preserved and can be loaded back into the tool. Shared PNG
files can have more than 16 colors. You can also use the PNG export and import
function to edit the ship skin in an image editor of your choice and/or use
external quantization methods to quantize each image to 16 colors.

To create a savegame, use the "Build" option. This will create a save file that
can be transferred to PSP/SAVEDATA/ on the PSP's memory stick or transferred to
the PS Vita using CMA or QCMA. The save file format only supports 16 colors per
image. You can either use the "Quant" button to automatically quantize the image
to 16 colors, or use an external editor to carry out the conversion manually.

Ship skins are saved in different "slots"; the "Slot" button can be used to
pick a slot, which will determine the folder name for the "Build" action.

Both the "Save" (as PNG) and "Build" (savegame file) will create a preview of
the ship skin -- be sure to pose your ship in a nice way in the editor view.
The preview will be put into the lower right section for exported PNGs and in
the ICON0.PNG ("savegame icon") file. This makes it easier to identify the ship
skin when having multiple skin savegame files.


DEFAULT LIVERIES
----------------

This program works without any files from the original game. However, if you
want to load the default liveries, you have to provide the game data files, as
the image data is read from those files. You can dump those files from your PSP
from the UMD release of the game or the digital PSN release on the Vita.

To load default liveries, copy fedata.wad (from the main game) and optionally
pack1_ui1.edat, pack2_ui1.edat, pack3_ui1.edat, pack4_ui1.edat (from the DLCs)
into the current directory. Note that the file names must be lowercase.


KNOWN ISSUES
------------

scolorq sometimes fails to quantize the image, the result is a black texture.
You can "UNDO" the quantization and try again, sometimes restarting the program
also helps.

PPSSPP shows a warning on-screen about old firmware when loading the ship
skin savegame. No such error is displayed on a PSP or Vita.


KEYBINDINGS
-----------

Most of the things can be controlled via the mouse and on-screen buttons,
here are key bindings that don't have corresponding UI elements:

  [m] ... Toggle magnifier
  [right mouse button] or [left mouse button + CTRL] ... Rotate view
  [middle mouse button] or [left mouse button + ALT] ... Pan view
  [q] ... Exit
